  "flag": {
    "name": "The Flag",
    "value": "The first documented lesbian pride flag was designed by graphic designer Sean Campbell in 1999 and published in a 2000s issue of the Palm Springs Gay and Lesbian Times, the \"Labrys Lesbian Flag\" <:_:1115866300858761236>. The \"Lipstick Lesbian Flag\" <:_:1115867721737977877> was the first design of the now more modern flag in 2010 and later had the \"Pink Flag\" <:_:1115867480649379840> in 2015. These flags adopted horizontal stripes harking to the Rainbow Pride Flag designed by Gilbert Baker but in a gradient of pink and white. Finally, in 2018, a woman on Tumblr named Emily Gwen posted her idea for the lesbian flag called the \"Sunset Lesbian Flag\" <:_:1115868994746974320>, which has 7 stripes and was later simplified to 5, aka now the \"Lesbian Pride Flag\" <:_:1108868440363642930>.
