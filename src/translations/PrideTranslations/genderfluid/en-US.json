  "history": {
    "name": "History",
    "value": "The concept of genderfluidity has roots that stretch back through history, though the specific term \"genderfluid\" is relatively modern. Various cultures globally have recognized non-binary or multiple gender roles, but the Western concept of genderfluidity gained prominence in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as part of the broader transgender rights movement. It challenges the traditional binary understanding of gender, proposing instead that gender can be dynamic and changing over time. In academic and social contexts, discussions about genderfluidity have helped illuminate the experiences of those who do not feel represented by static, binary gender definitions."
